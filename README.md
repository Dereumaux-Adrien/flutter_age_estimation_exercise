# flutter_age_estimation_exercise

An exercise made for a job application process

## Task

You want to build an app in which you receive an age assessment based on a given name.

The following functions should be included:

Name input
Send
Result
Restart
You can use the free and open API from agify to implement this (https://agify.io/).

Specifications:

Flutter as a framework
Architecture pattern of your choice
BLoC (preferred) or Riverpod as a state management solution
Try to develop this small use case as realistically as possible so that we get a good insight into your approach. The following user stories serve as acceptance criteria:

As an app user, I would like to know the estimated age of a given name.

As an app user, I would like to be able to repeat the assessment with a different name.

## Timestamps
Started (everything set up) at 19:00

First "full" version of the app as required at 22:00

Added Icons and splash screens at 22:30

After sleeping on it, added error management the next day in about 30 minutes (16:30 - 17:00)
